# Integration of presence-only data from several data sources. A case study on dolphins' spatial distribution



## Tutorial
Here we have created a tutorial, using simulated data, to show how inlabru can be used to fit a model similar to the one in the paper:

"Integration of presence-only data from several data sources. A case study on dolphins' spatial distribution" by S. Martino; D. Pace et al
 accepted for publication in Ecography (DOI 10.1111/ecog.05843)

but based on simulated data.

The model merges together two datasets, one from "social media" and one from ferry.

To run the code you need to have a newer version of R (>4.0) and to install both inla and inlabru.

Install the last testing version of inla from the [r-inla](https://www.r-inla.org/download-install)  and   the development version of inlabru from [GitHub][https://github.com/inlabru-org/inlabru].

## Observed data
The observed sighthings are also available [here](https://github.com/smar-git/SM-data-merging/tree/main/Observed_Sightings) together with a text file describing the dataset.
