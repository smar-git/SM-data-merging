## The combined use of spatial data derived from conventional research protocols and social media platforms: making this integration possible to predict dolphin distribution




Here we have created a tutorial, using simulated data, to show how inlabru can be used to fit a model simular to the one in the paper but based on simulated data.

The model merges together two datasets, one from "social media" and one from ferry.
