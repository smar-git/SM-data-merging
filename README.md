## The combined use of spatial data derived from conventional research protocols and social media platforms: making this integration possible to predict dolphin distribution




Here we have created a tutorial, using simulated data, to show how inlabru can be used to fit a model simular to the one in the paper but based on simulated data.

The model merges together two datasets, one from "social media" and one from ferry.

To run the code you need to have a newer version of R (>4.0) and to install both inla and inlabru.

Install the last testing version of inla from the [r-inla](https://www.r-inla.org/download-install)  and   the development version of inlabru from [GitHub][https://github.com/inlabru-org/inlabru].
